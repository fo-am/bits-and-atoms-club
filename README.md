# FoAM Kernow Nomadic Electronics Faculty

An ad-hoc electronics faculty currently in temporary residence at Falmouth University. This repo should augment our weekly sessions, and contains source code and circuits based on things we have tried, and a [wiki](https://github.com/fo-am/bits-and-atoms-club/wiki/Home) - feel free to edit the with things you find, or use the [issues](https://github.com/fo-am/foam-kernow-nomadic-hacklab/issues) to ask questions (you may need to register with github for this).

Basic rules:
- Do not fiddle with anything connected to mains power.
- Try to recycle e-waste where you can rather than buying new things (as long as it's battery powered, see above).

Some starting points:
- [Analogue electronics](https://github.com/fo-am/foam-kernow-nomadic-hacklab/wiki/Analogue-electronics)
- [Artistic references](https://github.com/fo-am/foam-kernow-nomadic-hacklab/wiki/Artistic-references)
- [Resourcing](https://github.com/fo-am/foam-kernow-nomadic-hacklab/wiki/Resourcing) (where to get stuff)
- [Coding tips](https://github.com/fo-am/foam-kernow-nomadic-hacklab/wiki/Coding-tips)
