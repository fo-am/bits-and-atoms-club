# FoAM Kernow Nomadic Electronics Faculty

An ad-hoc electronics faculty currently in temporary residence at Falmouth University. This repo should augment our weekly sessions, and contains source code and circuits based on things we have tried, and a [wiki](https://github.com/fo-am/bits-and-atoms-club/wiki/Home) - feel free to edit the with things you find, or use the [issues](https://github.com/fo-am/foam-kernow-nomadic-hacklab/issues) to ask questions (you may need to register with github for this).

Basic rules:
- Do not fiddle with anything connected to mains power.
- That's all!
