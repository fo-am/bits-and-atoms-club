# bits and atoms club

An ad-hoc electronics faculty for Falmouth University. This repo should augment our weekly sessions, feel free to edit the wiki with things you find, or use the issues to ask questions (you may need to register with github for this).

Departments:

* [Resourcing](https://github.com/fo-am/bits-and-atoms-club/wiki/Resourcing) - where to get hold of components.
* [Artistic references](https://github.com/fo-am/bits-and-atoms-club/wiki/Artistic-references) - inspiration.
* [Sensors](https://github.com/fo-am/bits-and-atoms-club/wiki/Sensors) - that we have used/discussed for projects.
* [Lighting ideas](https://github.com/fo-am/bits-and-atoms-club/wiki/Lighting-ideas) - some options for bright lighting beyond LEDs.
* [Analogue electronics](https://github.com/fo-am/bits-and-atoms-club/wiki/Analogue-electronics) - build your own synths and robots without computers or programming.
* [Arduino](https://github.com/fo-am/bits-and-atoms-club/wiki/Arduino) (coming soon)
